# Interactive Physics Simulations

A collection of interactive physics-based demos built for exploration, built from scratch and using popular frameworks. These simulations let you directly manipulate physical systems—like pushing a pendulum or moving a cart—and watch how they respond in real time.

## Project Goals

- Real-time interactive physics (maybe future projects with ML)
- Click, drag, and push elements to see how the system reacts
- Educational and intuitive visualization of dynamics
- Lightweight and easy to run
